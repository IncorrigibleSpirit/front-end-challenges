## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

During this project, I reviewed some concepts related to designing layouts and working with images and hyperlinks. Additionally, I learned and applied new concepts about typography, such as "fluid typography" and "variable fonts." Honestly, it was the first time I had heard about them, and I had a great experience calculating formulas and learning about the possibilities that variable fonts offer.

### Continued development

-JavaScript projects
-API projects
