## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use fluid sizing for padding and also styling the focus property.

```css
:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px dotted hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

```css
.card {
  padding: clamp(1.5rem, 1.5vw + 1.093rem, 2.5rem);
}
```

### Continued development

-Responsive design
-JavaScript projects
-API projects

### Useful resources

- [Modern Fluid Typography Using CSS Clamp](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/01/modern-fluid-typography-css-clamp/) - This article explains the correct method for calculating fluid typography and applying the same principles to fluid sizing.
